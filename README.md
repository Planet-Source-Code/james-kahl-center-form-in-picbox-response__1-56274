## Center Form In PicBox \(Response\)


</div>

### Description

This is in response to M1K3's submission about centering a form over a picture box. I don't want to rip into the flaws of his methodology and will only say that there were far too many assumptions on his part. I think this method is a much better alternative since you don't need to make sure that your form is a specific size, or the parent form or picture box has their properties set to specific values. Should be good for beginners since I use SystemParametersInfo with SPI_GETNONCLIENTMETRICS to determine border width of forms and height of Titlebars for forms.
